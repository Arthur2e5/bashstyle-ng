BashStyle-NG

=== Introduction ===

BashStyle-NG is a graphical Tool for changing the Bashs behaviour and look’n’feel.
Aswell as Readlines, Nanos and Vims.

It shipps a huge functionchain, that is used by the styles shipped with BS-NG, but can also be used separately.
Since v6.3 you have the opportunity to create your own prompts. For important notes on how to do so, refer
back to the documentation.

If you don’t understand an option or something does not work as expected read the documentation. It’s installed
in /usr/share/doc/bashstyle-ng/index.html ( /usr is default but may vary if you passed an other prefix to configure ).

Currently BS-NG shipps 15 pre-defined Styles for your prompt. Most of them can be modified via the Custom Prompt Builder.
--- Version 7.8 does not allow changing the default prompts (major internal changes), but 7.9 will again ---

If you want to save your current configuration and want to re-import it later (or for using it on a different user/machine)
you can do so via the Profiler (bs-ng-profiler –help).

Standalone (GConf-Free) Configuration (for faster Bash-Startup) can be created via the RCGenerator (see: rcgenerator –help).
