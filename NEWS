Overview of changes in v8.00 "We're Getting High With The Rhythm"

--- Important Note #1 ---

This release switched from GConf based configuration to ConfigObj.

Advantages:
	- *much* faster startup from terminal
	- usable from both python (ConfigObj) and Bash (ini-parser)
	  [read: all options could be changed from Bash now, too]
	- bs-ng-profiler and rc-generator no longer required

Disadvantages:
	- you have to fully re-setup BashStyle-NG (both GUI and Wizard)

--- Important Note #2 ---

This release requires GTK+3

=== Bug fixes ===
* #128 (ui): fixed C-P-B showing no longer existent, respectively
             wrong themes (and theme-code) from the "Choose Style
	     to modify:" combo-box
* #129 (configure): when configured via debian/rules, configure
                    got the prefix wrong
* #130 (profile): display-managers like XDM don't source /etc/profile.d/*,
                  so let nx-rc self-check, whether our profile was sourced
* #131 (readline/vim/nano): don't create an rc for readline, vim or nano,
                            if one is already going to be created (fixes
                            annoying issues when opening splitvt or two
                            terminals at a time)
* #132 (show_system_load): enforce LANG=C when calling uptime, so that it
                           properly works in all environments

=== Added Features ===
* configure can now check for GIR Repositories

=== Removed Features ===
* bs-ng-profiler (no longer required)
* rcgenerator (no longer required)

=== Misc changes ===
* shifted around some paths
  + DATADIR/rc/bin => PREFIX/bin
  + DATADIR/rc/opt => DATADIR/bin

* simplified debian/rules
* updated debian/docs

* several small fixups and improvements in the docs
  [chapters 00 - 04, 06 - 07]

* majorly improved the profile (/etc/profile.d/bashstyle.sh)

* updated all copyright year notices to "2007 - 2012"

* in the UI the name of a category now links to it's doc

Overview of changes in v7.12.1 "Do You Like The Sound Now?"

=== Bug Fixes ===
* #125 (ui): change the way the GUI retrieves it's own version and
             prefix, fixes possible startup-failures on foreign setups
* #126 (dirinfo-wrappers): even if the dirinfo-wrappers were disabled,
                           they could interfere with the original rm,
			   mv, cp and shred tools. If you updated from
			   version 7.12, please restart your machine
			   after you installed 7.12.1, to ensure every-
			   thing is fine with your setup
* #127 (uninstall): manual uninstall didn't remove GConf Schemas

=== Build & Installation ===
* show version of configure in --help
* add --quiet switch to configure
* fix configure --help message

* show version of make in --help
* improve look'n'feel of make out-put (more like configure now)
* fixed a typo in a make warning

=== Added Features ===

* updated my mail-address
* updated debian/ scripts to 3.0 (quilt)

Overview of changes in v7.12 "Planetary Collapse"

--- IMPORTANT NOTE #1 ---
We do now have a custom make system. See INSTALL.

--- IMPORTANT NOTE #2 ---
If you have custom settings stored in $HOME/.custom-rc, then rename the file
to $HOME/.bashstyle.custom, else they won't be loaded anymore.

--- (NOT SO) IMPORTANT NOTE #3 ---
This version of BS-NG can install wrapper for cp, mv, shred and rm, which
honour the NoCopy, NoMove, NoShred and NoDelete .dirinfo-flags (see below).

Those are only 90% syntax-compatible with the originals (say: `mv test{1,2}'
works, but `mv test{1,2} test{3,4}' does NOT -- only one {,} is supported),
maybe there are more incompatibilities. This will be fixed with Revision 3.

Therefore those wrappers are disabled by default, if you feel brave enough
to try them out pass `--dirinfo-enable' to the configure script.


=== Bugfixes ===
* #105 (unmark): properly unalias the bookmark
* #106 (bookmark): don't create a bookmark when no name is given
* #107 (about): fixed link to homepage of BS-NG
* #108 (profiler) (rcgenerator): load internal functions correctly
* #109 (ls-rc): make ls-rc linux-console compatible
* #110 (random-rc): remove no longer existenet styles from random-style-selector
* #111 (color-rc) (ls-rc): don't disable colors when on linux-console, but only
                           use default colors, which are black, red, yellow, green,
                           blue, cyan, magenta and white. Others are synonyms of them
                           while on linux-console (eg: iceblue = blue)
* #112 (man-rc) (ls-rc) (alias-rc) (options-rc): properly enable/disable colors according
                                                 to user-setting (ls, lscd, grep, man)
* #113 (vim-rc): fix setting highlighting
* #114 (readline-rc) (nano-rc) (vim-rc): check wether rc-file is accessible before writing it
* #115 (configure): change the way python modules are detected (fixes rpmbuild failure)
* #116 (ayoli) (clock-ad): the first line of the prompt in ayoli was longer than the screen
* #117 (check_opt): check_opt should error rather than exiting the session (...)
* #118 (autotools): there's a bug in the autotools which may not let you compile any source
                    if /bin/sh is not /bin/bash (...) workaround this by exporting
                    CONFIG_SHELL="/bin/bash" in /etc/profile.d/bashstyle.sh (...)
* #119 (nx-rc): when you started several shells at once ReadlineCFG, VimCFG and NanoCFG could
                have generated invalid configuration files (all instances of them adding the
		values), this is now prevented by starting BS-NG one by one
* #120 (clock-ad) (ayoli): fixed truncated the current directory
* #121 (nx-rc) (bs-ng-wizard): could have possibly hung up if bs-ng-wizard was loaded when no
			       config was not yet created
* #122 (bs-ng.py): don't wrongly require vte
* #123 (make): fixed installation outside of /usr as non-root user by not
               forcing the icons to be installed into /usr
* #124 (nx-rc): properly close the if-statement, which detects GDM

=== Build & Installation ===
