Overview of changes in v7.12 "Planetary Collapse"

!!! IMPORTANT NOTE #1 !!!
This version of BS-NG installs wrappers for cp, mv, shred and rm, which
honour the NoCopy, NoMove, NoShred and NoDelete .dirinfo-flags (see below).

To disable them, pass --dirinfo-disable to configure!

!!! IMPORTANT NOTE #2 !!!
We do now have a custom make system. See INSTALL.

=== Bugfixes ===
* #105 (unmark): properly unalias the bookmark
* #106 (bookmark): don't create a bookmark when no name is given
* #107 (about): fixed link to homepage of BS-NG
* #108 (profiler) (rcgenerator): load internal functions correctly
* #109 (ls-rc): make ls-rc linux-console compatible
* #110 (random-rc): remove no longer existenet styles from random-style-selector
* #111 (color-rc) (ls-rc): don't disable colors when on linux-console, but only
                           use default colors, which are black, red, yellow, green,
                           blue, cyan, magenta and white. Others are synonyms of them
                           while on linux-console (eg: iceblue = blue)
* #112 (man-rc) (ls-rc) (alias-rc) (options-rc): properly enable/disable colors according
                                                 to user-setting (ls, lscd, grep, man)
* #113 (vim-rc): fix setting highlighting
* #114 (readline-rc) (nano-rc) (vim-rc): check wether rc-file is accessible before writing it
* #115 (configure): change the way python modules are detected (fixes rpmbuild failure)
* #116 (ayoli): the first line of the prompt in ayoli was longer than the screen
* #117 (check_opt): check_opt should error rather than exiting the session (...)
* #118 (autotools): there's a bug in the autotools which may not let you compile any source
                    if /bin/sh is not /bin/bash (...) workaround this by exporting
                    CONFIG_SHELL="/bin/bash" in /etc/profile.d/bashstyle.sh (...)
* #119  (nx-rc): when you started several shells at once ReadlineCFG, VimCFG and NanoCFG could
                 have generated invalid configuration files (all instances of them adding the
		 values), this is now prevented by starting BS-NG one by one

  (directory-structure depth is 1 for all, means only

   all files on the same level than the .dirinfo file):
