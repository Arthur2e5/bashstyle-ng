Overview of changes in v9.0 "Nice Sprites"

=== NOTES ===

* The first-run-wizard (bsng-wizard) has been removed, relevant options
  have been merged into the main application, be sure to run the UI
  (Style for colorshell, else Advanced > Extras/GIT) after upgrade to
  re-adjust your settings that got lost by this change.

* This release removes the html-documentation. Instead every options will
  have a tooltip showing the name of the configuration variable (or --
  if none) and the description of the setting [work in progress].

=== Bug Fixes ===

* #154 (ui):
	icons for reverting to user-default or factory-default settings were
	missing from some GtkEntry and all GtkSpinButton.
* #155 (configure):
	when using --python configure flag that given python interpreter
	was not used to check if required modules are available
* #156 (text2morse):
	python3 support in text2morse
* #157 (readline):
	when changing settings for readline they didn't take effect immediately
* #158 (lockfile):
	the lockfile module required additional fixes to fully work with both python2
	and python3
* #159 (pkgconfig):
	install pkgconfig file into ${PREFIX}/share/pkgconfig, not ${PREFIX}/lib/pkgconfig/
* #160 (nx-rc):
	fixed history settings from ui were not always applied on the shell
* #161 (colorshell):
	random selection of colors in colorshell hasn't really been random
* #162 (config):
	if a vendor configuration (/etc/bs-ng_vendor.ini) exists, let the revert
	configuration icon on GtkEntry and GtkSpinButton revert to vendor
	configuration instead of factory configuration
* #163 (colorshell):
	fix colorshell not being available to all prompt styles
* #164 (styles):
	fix PRE_PROMPT_COMMAND not available to monochrome versions of ayoli,
	clock, clock-ad and poweruser prompt styles [if you create a function
	of that name in ${HOME}/.bashstyle.custom you can hook into those
	style's PROMPT_COMMAND (the other styles don't have PROMPT_COMMAND,
	so you can freely create one for them)]
* #165 (colors):
	fixed pscolor not being set
* #166 (styles):
	fixed that most styles called trunc_pwd instead of truncpwd
* #167 (truncpwd):
	change the way truncpwd obtains it's settings, so that it always
	works as expected (and only loads them once)
* #168 (custom prompt builder):
	fixed custom prompt builder not properly inserting default styles
	into the textbuffers for further customization
* #169 (truncpwd):
	when maximum length of pwd is 0 don't truncate it all.
* #170 (config):
	when configuration file exists, but is broken, restore either vendor
	or factory default configuration for the user
* #171 (wrappers):
	if you felt brave enough to enable dirinfo wrappers, they still didn't
        work properly, because of a change in the setup mechanism that wasn't
	reflected in the wrappers
* #172 (clock-ad) (truncpwd):
	when changing to a user not having BashStyle-NG set-up prompts were
	incorrect, as some required settings for truncpwd, respectively
	clock-ad's internal pwd-truncating function, were not set

=== Wizard-Merge ===

*** the following options have been merged from the wizard into the main
    application: colorshell, colorshell_reset, use_lscd, lscd_opts, cd_writer,
    dd_noerror, restore_directory, debug_verbose, user_birthday, git_user_name,
    git_user_mail, git_color, git_editor, git_aliases, git_signkey,

*** everything but the above as been dropped.

=== New Features ===

* Keybindings (Emacs editing mode)
  - This allows you to change 29 default bash/readline keybindings.
    (2 of them are not used by default).
  - Additionally theres a 30th, custom, keybinding: complete-path.
    If you press the assigned key while the cursor is at the end of a
    string resembling an executable, the complete path will be added to
    the command line.

* loop function: loop for a colon-divided list (eg. PATH) and return
  the full path if the second arguement is found inside any member of
  the colon-divided list (similar to which, but for any provided list
  and both files and directories)
* reload function: a clean function to reload .bashrc (x2cd)
* quickscript function: writes all commands in history to a file.
  starting point is the last occurence of "###" (joedhon)
* filename function: prints only filename from a path
* filepath function: only prints containing directory from a path
* filenoext function: prints only filename without extension from a path
* filext function: only prints file extension from a path
* showip function: displays your external IP address
* ngroups function: system default 'groups' lists all user-groups you're in
  ngroups lists all user-groups you're NOT in. (gniourf_gniourf)
* ols function: ls -l with octal file permissions
* psgrep function: find process by name (flatcap)

* explain git aliases in ui
* ls alias to git (prettified version of log)
* lsb alias to git (sort branches (local + remote) by last activity)
* git_zip function: create zip archive from master
* git_undelete function: re-checkout all accidently deleted, tracked files
* git_funmsg function: random, funny commit message
* git_hub function: open github url for a repository using x-www-browser
* git_revno function: get classic revision number (like in SVN)

=== Removed Features ===

* rd alias to pw -P removed
* reload alias to source ~/.bashrc removed

=== Misc. Changes ===

* use less termcap variables instead of compiled terminfo files for colored
  manpages (and other pager output)
* improved user interface (GtkIconView and GtkNotebook combination)
* make whiptail an optional dependency (with the removal of bs-ng-wizard
  it is only required for 'dirinfo --create')
* several improvements in "clock advanced" prompt style
* look for python3 by default, fallback to python
* updated copyright notices 2007 - 2015

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Overview of changes in v8.4 "Mind The Gap"

=== NOTES ===

* BashStyle-NG uses ConfigObj for storing configuration. Since
  version 5.0.0 ConfigObj supports Python 3.2 and 3.3. If your
  distribution ships an older version of ConfigObj, use the
  --python=/path/to/python2 configure flag to ensure python2 is
  being used.

=== Bug fixes ===

* #148 (alias):
	fix aliases #8 and #9 set from UI weren't setup on Bash
* #149 (count_files):
	-f/+f and -d/+d params were exchanged
* #150 (debian):
	make bashstyle-ng exlicitely depend on python-configobj
* #151 (make):
	fix generating pot file for bs-ng-wizard
* #152 (configure):
	fix detection of python version if it's an release-candidate
* #153 (python3):
	full python3 support (ConfigObj only supports 3.2 and 3.3 officially)

=== New Features ===

* direxpand: Bash >= 4.3 features a new shopt: direxpand. Enabling this
             causes Bash to expand directory names in completion like
             Bash 4.1 did.
* globasciiranges: Bash >= 4.3 features a new shop: globasciirange.
                   Enabling this causes Bash to use character ordering
                   like in the C locale when globbing ranges.
* show-mode-in-prompt: New readline option to show the current editing
                       mode in the prompt

=== Misc. Changes ===

* minor UI improvement (tabs on the left, smaller icons on tabs,
  text below icons on tab)
* add "Report Bugs" button to the about dialog
* updated and completed german translation

* configure 4.2.3: add --bashrc option to pass a specific system
                   wide bashrc (required for bashstyle-ng init)

* bump supported python versions to 3.3 (only if you have ConfigObj 5)

Overview of changes in v8.00 "We're Getting High With The Rhythm"

--- Important Note #1 ---

This release switched from GConf based configuration to ConfigObj.

Advantages:
	- *much* faster startup from terminal
	- usable from both python (ConfigObj) and Bash (ini-parser)
	  [read: all options could be changed from Bash now, too]
	- bs-ng-profiler and rc-generator no longer required

Disadvantages:
	- you have to fully re-setup BashStyle-NG (both GUI and Wizard)

--- Important Note #2 ---

This release requires GTK+3 / Python-GI

=== Bug fixes ===
* #128 (ui):
	fixed C-P-B (Custom Prompt Builder) showing no longer existent
	themes (and theme-code) from the "Choose Style to modify:" combo-box
* #129 (configure):
	when configured via debian/rules, configure got the prefix wrong
* #130 (profile):
	display-managers like XDM don't source /etc/profile.d/*,
	so let nx-rc self-check, whether our profile was sourced
* #131 (readline/vim/nano):
	don't create an rc for readline, vim or nano, if one is already going
	to be created (fixes annoying issues when opening splitvt or two
	terminals at a time)
* #132 (show_system_load):
	enforce LANG=C when calling uptime, so that it properly works in all cases
* #133 (toolbox/about):
	fix the bug that the toolbox and about-dialog could only
	be properly invoked once per session
* #134 (configure):
	fix detection of gir-repository-path on x86_64 (tested on Fedora 18)
* #135 (functions):
	define all functions as such, to prevent errors on startup if a vendor
	alias has the same name then a BS-NG function (eg: ll on Fedora)
* #136 (make):
	fixed uninstallation of BS-NG
* #137 (debian/control):
	make debian package depend on gir1.2-gtk-3.0

* 'bsng-help' function (auto-generates help messages)

=== Removed Features ===
* bs-ng-profiler (no longer required)

Overview of changes in v7.12.1 "Do You Like The Sound Now?"

=== Bug Fixes ===
* #125 (ui): change the way the GUI retrieves it's own version and
             prefix, fixes possible startup-failures on foreign setups
* #126 (dirinfo-wrappers): even if the dirinfo-wrappers were disabled,
                           they could interfere with the original rm,
			   mv, cp and shred tools. If you updated from
			   version 7.12, please restart your machine
			   after you installed 7.12.1, to ensure every-
			   thing is fine with your setup
* #127 (uninstall): manual uninstall didn't remove GConf Schemas

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Overview of changes in v7.12 "Planetary Collapse"

--- IMPORTANT NOTE #1 ---
We do now have a custom make system. See INSTALL.

--- IMPORTANT NOTE #2 ---
If you have custom settings stored in $HOME/.custom-rc, then rename the file
to $HOME/.bashstyle.custom, else they won't be loaded anymore.

--- (NOT SO) IMPORTANT NOTE #3 ---
This version of BS-NG can install wrapper for cp, mv, shred and rm, which
honour the NoCopy, NoMove, NoShred and NoDelete .dirinfo-flags (see below).

Those are only 90% syntax-compatible with the originals (say: `mv test{1,2}'
works, but `mv test{1,2} test{3,4}' does NOT -- only one {,} is supported),
maybe there are more incompatibilities. This will be fixed with Revision 3.

Therefore those wrappers are disabled by default, if you feel brave enough
to try them out pass `--dirinfo-enable' to the configure script.


=== Bugfixes ===
* #105 (unmark): properly unalias the bookmark
* #106 (bookmark): don't create a bookmark when no name is given
* #107 (about): fixed link to homepage of BS-NG
* #108 (profiler) (rcgenerator): load internal functions correctly
* #109 (ls-rc): make ls-rc linux-console compatible
* #110 (random-rc): remove no longer existenet styles from random-style-selector
* #111 (color-rc) (ls-rc): don't disable colors when on linux-console, but only
                           use default colors, which are black, red, yellow, green,
                           blue, cyan, magenta and white. Others are synonyms of them
                           while on linux-console (eg: iceblue = blue)
* #112 (man-rc) (ls-rc) (alias-rc) (options-rc): properly enable/disable colors according
                                                 to user-setting (ls, lscd, grep, man)
* #113 (vim-rc): fix setting highlighting
* #114 (readline-rc) (nano-rc) (vim-rc): check wether rc-file is accessible before writing it
* #115 (configure): change the way python modules are detected (fixes rpmbuild failure)
* #116 (ayoli) (clock-ad): the first line of the prompt in ayoli was longer than the screen
* #117 (check_opt): check_opt should error rather than exiting the session (...)
* #118 (autotools): there's a bug in the autotools which may not let you compile any source
                    if /bin/sh is not /bin/bash (...) workaround this by exporting
                    CONFIG_SHELL="/bin/bash" in /etc/profile.d/bashstyle.sh (...)
* #119 (nx-rc): when you started several shells at once ReadlineCFG, VimCFG and NanoCFG could
                have generated invalid configuration files (all instances of them adding the
		values), this is now prevented by starting BS-NG one by one
* #120 (clock-ad) (ayoli): fixed truncated the current directory
* #121 (nx-rc) (bs-ng-wizard): could have possibly hung up if bs-ng-wizard was loaded when no
			       config was not yet created
* #122 (bs-ng.py): don't wrongly require vte
* #123 (make): fixed installation outside of /usr as non-root user by not
               forcing the icons to be installed into /usr
* #124 (nx-rc): properly close the if-statement, which detects GDM

=== Build & Installation ===
