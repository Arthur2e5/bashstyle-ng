BashStyle-NG

=== Introduction ===

BashStyle-NG is a graphical Tool for changing the Bashs behaviour and look'n'feel.
Aswell as Readlines, Nanos and Vims.

It shipps a huge functionchain, that is used by the styles shipped with BS-NG,
but can also be used separately. Since v6.3 you have the opportunity to create
your own prompts. For important notes on how to do so, refer back to the documentation.

If you don't understand an option or something does not work as expected read the
documentation. It's installed in /usr/share/doc/bashstyle-ng/index.html ( /usr is default
but may vary if you passed an other prefix to configure ).

Currently BS-NG shipps 12 pre-defined Styles for your promp, which can be modified via the
Custom Prompt Builder.

If you want to save your current configuration and want to re-import it later (or for using
it on a different user/machine) you can do so via the Profiler (bs-ng-profiler –help).

Standalone (GConf-Free) Configuration (for faster Bash-Startup) can be created via the
RCGenerator (see: rcgenerator –help).

=== GIT Access ===

You can get the latest in-development version by running:

git clone git://git.tuxfamily.org/gitroot/bashstyleng/bashstyleng.git

Once you've done the initial clone, you can use `git pull' to stay up-to-date.

Use `git log' to view the full log.
